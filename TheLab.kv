        # Over ridding the size is easy put width and height as none and use size or width and height properties like as follows

        # height: "100dp"

        # Moreover we can use custom positions to place buttons or other widgets to our desired positions by using following syntax:
        # pos_hint: x or center_x or right for vertical orientation
        # pos_hint: y or center_y or top for horizontal orientation
        # pos_hint: {"x":.5}
